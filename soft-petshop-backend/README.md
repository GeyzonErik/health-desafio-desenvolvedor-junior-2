- [Swagger](https://swagger.io/)
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

## Getting Started

### First of all
- You'll need have [NodeJs](https://nodejs.dev) instaled in your machine, such as[Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).
- And you'll need use an code editor for a better code management. My recomedation: [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Starting the project
Assuming that you already have all the requirements and you now a little about SQL and Postgre

You can follow the following instructions:

```
1- First, clone this repository in your machine:

$git clone https://github.com/GeyzonErik/health-desafio-desenvolvedor-junior-2.git

2- Now you need to enter in the folder that the git had created
3- Open the soft-petshop-backend folder and create a file named: .env
4- put the following information in the file (modifying what need):

DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgresUser:password@localhost:5432/database_name"

5- Now open the soft-petshop-backend folder in the terminal and run the following comands:

> npm install
> npm start

```
After all the steps the software would be open and you can:

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) with your browser to see the API documentation.

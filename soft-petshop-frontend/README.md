## Getting Started

### First of all
- You'll need have [NodeJs](https://nodejs.dev) instaled in your machine, such as [Git](https://git-scm.com/).
- And you'll need use an code editor for a better code management. My recomedation: [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Starting the project
Assuming that you already have all the requirements you can follow the following instructions:

```
1- First, clone this repository in your machine:

$git clone https://github.com/GeyzonErik/health-desafio-desenvolvedor-junior-2.git

2- Now you need to enter in the folder that the git had created
3- Open the soft-petshop-frontend folder in the terminal and run the following comands:

> npm install
> npm run dev

```

After all the steps you can:

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

And you can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
